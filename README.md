## Collecting Stickers
One of the exciting features of this project is the ability to collect stickers related to the Euro 2024 football tournament. Users can collect stickers of their favorite teams, players, and memorable moments from the tournament.

### Overview of Collected Stickers
To keep track of the stickers collected, a dedicated section will be implemented. This section will provide an overview of all the stickers collected by the user, including the team, player, or moment associated with each sticker. Users can easily browse through their collection and reminisce about the tournament.

##YouTube API
If you want to get the Jupyter Notebook started, you need to create a credentials.json file and add there your API Key from developers.google.com. Otherwise the application won't start, as there is a need to authorize the API Key. After creating a credentials.json file you can run the Jupyter notebook. It creates a .csv and a .db file which is used for SQLite3.

After that you can run the Jupyter Notebook and the app.py which allows you to see the data in a Web Application on the address http://127.0.0.1:5000/
